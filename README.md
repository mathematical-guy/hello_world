print('--'*32)

print('This program is to add to integers')

print('--'*32)

a = int(input('Enter First Number: '))
b = int(input('Enter Second Number: '))

c = a + b                   #Addition of Two integers
for i in range(3):
    print()

print('--'*32)
print('--'*32)
print('Addition of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(a, b, c))
